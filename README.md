These changes a better user experience for all visitors and improves its visibility in search engine rankings, and also makes the code easier to maintain in the future.

## Code Refactor Examples


```html
<div class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
```

Converting the above non-semantic div with the class of 'header' to an appropriate [<header> semantic element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp). 

```html
<header>
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

```

This change require some additional modification to the CSS selector: 

```css
.header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```

No longer targeting the element on the page with the class of 'header' but instead the css selector targeting the 'header' element 

```css
header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}

```

## Learning Points 


Through this project, I learned about accessibility standards, best practices for Search Engine Optimization, make to make code more readabile and maintainable, and general best practices in web development. This was also a good lesson in being thorough giving attention to detail, as it is very easy to overlook small details. Furthermore, this was a good lesson in quality assurance as I had to make sure the project met all the given acceptance criteria.

I also learned the importance of version control, deploying a website, and making frequent meaningful commits to your repository with descriptive messages.
